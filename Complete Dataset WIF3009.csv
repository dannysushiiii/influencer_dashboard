If you‚Äôve been stuck trying to figure out how to lose fat, this is the no-fluff guide to fat loss ‚Äî and staying lean for good. In this video, learn how to cut body fat, preserve muscle, and reach a maintainable 12% body fat using smart training, strategic nutrition, and psychology. Whether you're looking to lose fat or finally learn how to lose body fat without rebounding, this is your blueprint. To get to 12% body fat from 15%, it took me just six weeks. But based on a DEXA scan analysis of 9,000+ American men, fewer than 1% ever reach 12% or below. That‚Äôs why understanding how to lose fat strategically, not just quickly, is critical ‚Äî and why I worked with five top scientists and elite coaches to bring you this plan.

First, how to lose body fat without losing muscle with Dr. Mike Israetel from RP Strength. If you lose weight without lifting, up to 50% of that can be muscle. That not only gives a ‚Äúskinny‚Äù look instead of ‚Äúlean,‚Äù it also cranks up hunger and cravings. Your biggest weapon when aiming to lose fat while preserving muscle? Weight training. One adjustment Dr. Mike recommends in a fat loss phase is using lighter weights with higher reps. Your strength may dip, but your endurance improves ‚Äî and higher rep training still protects muscle just as well. When should you switch to this approach? Continue training normally until you feel real fatigue and strength begins to decline.

How to cut body fat with the right workout split: Dr. Mike suggests that slightly more frequent training ‚Äî hitting each muscle group 2‚Äì3x per week ‚Äî is more effective during a fat loss phase. Massive workouts that train just one muscle become less effective when you‚Äôre depleted. Instead, go for:

3x/week: Full body
4x/week: Upper/lower
5x/week: U/L/P/P/L
6x/week: P/P/L/P/P/L

A recent study showed even just 2 short full-body workouts a week (6 sets per muscle total) helped preserve 100% of muscle mass ‚Äî even when combined with 5 hours of cardio. This shows that training smarter, not necessarily more, is key when figuring out how to lose fat without sacrificing muscle.

""You can eat junk food and still lose fat and maintain lean mass.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Layne Norton. Here‚Äôs how to lose body fat through your diet: start by determining your protein intake: 1.8 to 2.8g per kg of body weight. Then split the rest of your calories between carbs and fats based on what you‚Äôll stick to long term. Whether you like savory or sweet, it‚Äôs adherence that matters most. For fat sources, think olive oil, peanut butter, and eggs. Carbs can be timed around workouts: oats before, potatoes after. And yes ‚Äî even sugar isn‚Äôt the enemy. In a calorie deficit, sugar doesn‚Äôt prevent fat loss. What matters most is your total macros and calories.

Now, how many calories do you need for fat loss? Multiply your weight in lbs by 10‚Äì13 to estimate your starting point. Adjust based on your activity level. But remember: these calculators can be off by 500+ calories. Instead, track your weight daily and aim for 1‚Äì2 lbs of fat loss per week. If things stall, adjust. My app did this for me ‚Äî taking me from 2,300 to 2,000 calories after four weeks ‚Äî which was essential for continuing to lose fat as my metabolism adapted.

As Dr. Eric Trexler explains, your body adapts fast. For every 5% weight drop, you may burn 100‚Äì200 fewer calories daily. This slows progress dramatically. The fix? If your weight stalls for 2 weeks, lower calories by 100‚Äì150. But know your limit: don‚Äôt try to cut body fat by more than 10% in a single phase. Instead, pause, maintain, or lean bulk before going for another drop.

Dr. Eric Helms shares how to lose fat with cardio ‚Äî the right way. More cardio doesn‚Äôt always equal more fat loss. Your body tends to offset calorie burn by moving less or increasing hunger. Instead, let your diet do the heavy lifting. Cardio helps with appetite regulation and energy balance ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not the main tool. If you get fewer than 7‚Äì9k steps a day, fix that first. Then aim to walk more or add 2‚Äì3 cardio sessions weekly, only when necessary. This is how to cut body fat without over-relying on cardio.

According to Laurin Conlin, mindset traps derail even the best plans. One big one? Eating food that‚Äôs not even enjoyable just because it‚Äôs there. Save calories for meals that truly matter. Another trap? Guilt. Restricting all day before a big meal leads to overeating and the shame spiral. Instead, eat normally beforehand and enjoy the experience. And when it comes to hunger, stop trying to hack it. Accept that it‚Äôs part of the process.",0,398,306,8

Most people make common gym mistakes that quietly wreck their joints ‚Äî and often lead to joint pain, from shoulder pain to deadlift pain (especially in the lower back). But they‚Äôre easily avoidable. Instead of just copying the big guys in the gym or online, the real fix is actually understanding YOUR own anatomy. After years of researching movement science and working as a Kinesiologist, I found 5 simple tweaks that instantly fix those workout mistakes and ease joint pain ‚Äî and more importantly, save you from bigger problems down the road.

https://www.youtube.com/jeremyethier/?sub_confirmation=1

Now, the first fix for your joint pain you need to make is to start using a form that matches your anatomy. It‚Äôs not talked about enough, but your individual bone length, joint mobility, and even the shape of your sockets change what ‚Äúproper‚Äù form looks like for you. So experiment with simple adjustments. If you lean forward when you squat, try elevating your heels onto plates. Now this will hit more of the quads rather than the glutes, but you might also feel less low back strain, less joint pain, and just a smoother squat overall. But also play around with your squat stance.

Then for deadlifts, let‚Äôs say you have trouble getting into position and struggle with deadlift pain, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd try elevating the bottom position or using sumo instead. This applies to machines, too, where you‚Äôll want to adjust the setup to better suit your anatomy. 

Everyone blames a weak rotator cuff when shoulder pain shows up. But you can‚Äôt ignore your bigger mid-back muscles like the traps and rhomboids. If they‚Äôre weak, your shoulder joint wobbles with every press or pull ‚Äî and that instability is a fast track to joint pain. To make matters worse, most of us sit all day with our shoulders pitched forward, making it tough to activate these muscles. So how can you fix it? Two things: learn how to properly engage your back muscles. And sprinkle in some ‚Äúprehab‚Äù exercises to further strengthen these areas, as well as the rotator cuff. After every upper‚Äëbody session, I finish with 3 sets of face pulls or prone arm circles. Then, every morning and anytime I step away from the desk, I‚Äôll lean on the wall and bang out 10 wall slides to keep things strong. Now, while these changes will make a massive difference in your back strength and shoulder health, you don‚Äôt want to make the next mistake, which has to do with your grip.

Most people don‚Äôt know this, but your arms have what‚Äôs called a natural ‚Äúcarrying angle.‚Äù Anytime you do an exercise where both of your hands are locked onto a bar, handle, or even a machine, you‚Äôre forcing both sides to follow the same fixed path. Plus, even though elbows angle in or out, your wrists can‚Äôt rotate to match. Tendons, ligaments, and muscles pull on each other, which means that strain in your wrists can eventually lead to strain in your elbows and even your shoulders. And when this goes on long enough, it can absolutely turn into joint pain. Now, the fix for one of the most unknown gym mistakes isn‚Äôt to eliminate these exercises altogether. Instead, it‚Äôs this: For each muscle group, work in at least one exercise that lets your hands and elbows rotate. E.g., Dumbbell presses for chest and shoulders. But now that you‚Äôve fixed your workouts, it‚Äôs crucial you avoid the next mistake if you don't want joint pain ‚Äî which has to do with how you‚Äôre progressing them over time.

Fourth of our workout mistakes causing joint pain: not being smart with progression. Pushing too soon and making little compromises with your form just to lift that extra weight adds up, and can lead to an immediate injury, or a slow‚Äëburn strain that shows up months later. And often, that strain is disguised as joint pain that never seems to go away. So if a PR isn‚Äôt there, don‚Äôt force it. If your body isn‚Äôt ready for more weight, just aim to do 1‚Äì2 more reps. Or, try to match the same reps as last time but with better form or less effort. The farther you advance in the gym, the slower your progress, and your programming needs to reflect that. But you also need to pay attention to your body along the way‚Ä¶

If your elbow whispers ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt feel so great,‚Äù don‚Äôt reply with ‚Äúsuck it up.‚Äù Lift lighter for higher reps or just switch it up. In fact, every 8‚Äì12 weeks, take a look at your plan. Are there any exercises you feel are starting to wear you out? Your joints need a break from doing the same movement over and over again, so consider changing things up to avoid joint pain. Even minor changes can help with joint pain, and you can always go right back to your favorite exercise after giving your joints a breath of fresh air. These small adjustments can prevent recurring joint pain and keep your body training longer and stronger.",0,442,306,8

Tons of fitness videos promise the secret to fast fat loss... Then hit you with a ‚Äúfat loss workout‚Äù that‚Äôd make a Navy SEAL throw up, a ‚Äúfat loss diet‚Äù that repeatedly calls for boiled chicken for lunch‚Ä¶ and lots of crying. If you‚Äôre not suffering, it‚Äôs not working. But what if I told you a simple walking method can help you lose fat faster than killing yourself with cardio? I know that sounds hard to believe, but it‚Äôs just one of four science-backed fat loss strategies I‚Äôll show you to help you lose fat up to 2x faster‚Äîwithout losing muscle. And I‚Äôve crunched the numbers to prove it.

0:00 - 0:30 : Why Most Fat Loss Plans Fail
0:30 - 4:04 : Adjusting Fat Intake
4:05 - 7:30 : The Walking Method
7:31 - 11:06 : The Accidental Deficit
11:07 - 13:37 : Unique Foods For Fat Loss
13:38 : What Results To Expect

The first fat loss strategy is adjusting your fat intake. For health reasons you don‚Äôt want to go below around 35 to 50 grams of fat per day. Here's what I want you to do: Think about the fats you eat everyday. Cheese, butter, and even healthy fats like avocado. Starting tomorrow, cut however much you usually have of these in half. I want you to also check if you‚Äôre eating any high fat proteins. Try having just one of these daily, then for all your other meals, choose a more pure protein source from this list. And you can apply this same concept even when you‚Äôre eating out. If you just cut 1 fat source in half and make 1 protein swap, boom you‚Äôre saving up to 250 calories per day, which already speeds up your fat loss by half a pound per week.

And you can lose even more by combining it with the next strategy, the walking method. What most people don‚Äôt know is that instead of relying on a specific ‚Äúfat loss workout‚Äù, a highly active person can burn up to 2,000 more calories daily just from NEAT compared to someone who's sedentary. While cardio is great for your heart and health, it‚Äôs kind of just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù for fat loss. A much better approach I personally use myself and with our Built With Science clients is plain old walking. Now I‚Äôve set a goal in my Built With Science app to hit 10,000 steps a day and it keeps track of it for me. But you can use the health app on your phone, and just aim for anywhere between 7,000 to 12,000 steps a day. But 30 minutes of walking is already 3,000 steps and for the average person can burn anywhere from 100 to 200 calories. Do that simple 30 minute walk every day and after a month you‚Äôll lose an extra pound of fat, or an extra quarter pound of fat per week.

And you can speed this up even faster with a dieting strategy I call the accidental deficit. During your busiest days, rely on quick grab-and-go protein sources and ready to eat fruits. Then when you finally get home, have a big dinner of lean protein and vegetables instead of ordering takeout. Then, just go to bed before you start snacking. If you do this right, you could end your day eating as little as 1,300 to 1,600 calories. For most people this is a huge deficit and is why I do NOT recommend doing this ‚Äúfat loss diet‚Äù more than once or twice a week max - and preferably on your rest days. But even just doing this once a week can increase your average daily calorie deficit by about 100 calories, and help you get rid of an extra quarter pound per week.

But this will work even better if you combine it with the last strategy for fast fat loss - eating foods that do the work for you. Most people don‚Äôt know this but your body burns a certain amount of calories just from digesting food. And protein is special because a solid 20 to 30% of its calories immediately get burned up for digestion, absorption, and metabolism - which is more than double any other food. As a result, studies have shown going from a low-protein to a high-protein diet can raise your daily calorie burn by 4‚Äì5%. For a 2000 calorie diet, that‚Äôs an extra 90‚Äì100 calories burned per day. It may not sound like much, but that‚Äôs like doing a 10 minute jog everyday, and can add up to a pound of fat loss every month. Not to mention all the muscle building benefits this has as well. So take your bodyweight in lbs and multiply it by 0.8. If you‚Äôre not getting anywhere near that, then bump up how much protein you have in each meal to get closer to that target. And if you‚Äôre already hitting that, great, focus on swapping your processed foods for whole foods high in fiber and resistant starch.

Put all 4 strategies together, and even being conservative with the numbers, you're looking at an extra 1.2 pounds of fat loss per week. That‚Äôs over twice what most people manage on a typical diet.",0,571,306,8

But the lats are one of the toughest muscles to target.¬†For years, I did the usual back exercises during my lats workout: heavy rows and pulldowns. My strength went up, my upper back and arms got bigger, but my lats? Nonexistent. But everything changed when I started using the 2 best lat exercises I‚Äôm going to share. And the same transformation can happen for you if you do the 3 things I did as part of my ‚Äúwide back workout‚Äù I‚Äôll reveal here.

For this wide back workout article, I couldn‚Äôt rely heavily on studies like I usually do because there are barely any reliable, conclusive studies on how to actually grow the lats. So, to get real answers, I teamed up with some experts. The first of whom is biomechanics expert Kassem Hanson. The first exercise he showed me was for the lower lats. Kassem explained that because the fibers in this area run downward, you‚Äôre going to want to do some kind of lat pulldown, but pulling narrow. The different grip options you have depending on what you have available are overhand narrow grip, underhand narrow grip, and neutral grip. You could also go with my current favourite, the single-arm pulldown.

But regardless of what grip you use, here's the real game-changer for your lats workout. For the deepest lat stretch, lean your body back about 10-15 degrees.¬†Then, as you pull, think about shoving your shoulder down rather than just moving your arms. But to make sure you‚Äôre not just using your biceps, don‚Äôt pull the grip towards your chest.¬†Keep your elbow in front of you and pull your elbow down towards your hips.¬†

Now, unfortunately, without cables, there‚Äôs no good way to work the lower lats during your back workout with dumbbells. But you can still do this on a pull-up bar and see good results. All you do is, rather than using a wide overhand grip, either use a narrow overhand grip, an underhand grip, or the best option, a neutral grip.¬†Lean back slightly, keeping your elbows in front, and pull them down towards your hips while pushing your shoulders down and away from your ears.¬†

If you want the kind of wide back that‚Äôll make Greg Doucette want to run a ‚Äúnatty or not‚Äù video on you, then you‚Äôll need the second of our best lat exercises to light up your mid and upper lats as well. To target them, you‚Äôll still want an exercise where your elbows can pull narrow, close to your body.¬†But unlike the lower lats, where the muscle fibers all run downward, the upper lats' fibers run more horizontally, with some fibers traveling just slightly downward. That means we need a rowing exercise where the arm can pull at a slight angle downwards. 

For the dumbbell version, use either an incline bench or elevate the back of a flat bench so that it angles downward. Then, set up just how you would with a single-arm dumbbell row, but the downward angle will now set your arm up so it‚Äôs pulling at a high-to-low angle. Then, simply pull your elbow down and back towards your hips, keeping it tight to your sides.¬†Now if you don‚Äôt find that as comfortable, doing this on a flat bench can still work. A crucial mistake you need to avoid if you want a wide back: Keep your chest level with the ground, and then simply focus on pulling your elbow down and back towards your hips, keeping it tight against your sides.¬†

But for the best results for a wide back, I prefer using cables.¬†instead of sitting fully upright, lean slightly forward while keeping your core and back stable. I made sure that my arm angle is now pulling from high to low, which mimics the same effect as if the cable were positioned higher up. Kassem also mentioned putting your feet a bit lower on the plates can make this more comfortable. When it comes to grip, shoulder-width neutral grip is once again ideal, but a V-bar can also work.¬†But just like with the pulldown exercise, all of this setup will be for nothing if you don‚Äôt pull the right way.¬†Think about pulling your elbows down and back towards your hips.¬†

One last bonus technique to share with you that you can apply not just to your back exercises but your other muscle groups as well. Don‚Äôt end your sets once you can‚Äôt pull the weight. Instead, keep it going and go to true failure by trying to get about 3-5 half reps until the weight just won‚Äôt budge. On pulldowns, you can take this even further after your half-reps by switching to keeping your arm straight and raising and lowering your shoulder to take your lower lats even past failure.¬†Doing these 2 lats exercises for 3 - 4 sets of 10 - 15 reps, with the half reps after every set, is more than enough to grow your lats.¬†And that's the ""secret"" to building a wide back.",0,563,306,8

HUGE shoutout to Fork to Fit for helping cater the event:
https://www.instagram.com/forktofitkitchen

After talking to the residents in the most obese city in America, one thing became clear: most people blamed the food. So I decided to check it out for myself. It didn‚Äôt take long to understand what they meant. Each meal looked like a generous helping of food, but I was surprised by how long I could keep eating. The reason? The food is highly processed and low in fiber, so I could eat a ton before feeling full. Worse still, these foods hijack your brain‚Äôs reward system, delivering a rush of pleasure that fades quickly ‚Äî keeping you coming back for more. On top of that, the massive portions trick your brain into thinking you haven‚Äôt eaten that much.

I brought in Kelly, our head dietitian at Built With Science, who‚Äôs helped thousands of clients make lasting dietary changes. We also partnered with a local business called Fork to Fit, which creates calorie-friendly meals to combat the overwhelming fast food culture and health problem in McAllen. Together, we planned to host a free community workshop, offering a healthy dinner, take-home meals, and a bag of BWS protein powder. But getting people to show up? That was harder than expected. Even Kelly had a tough time recruiting people at the mall. After half a day handing out flyers, we finally got over 20 people committed to attending.

The longer I stayed in McAllen, the more I realized: the food is only part of the obesity problem. McAllen is a drive-only city, covered in 4-lane roads, with sidewalks that end abruptly and crosswalk buttons that often don‚Äôt work. Walking isn‚Äôt a realistic option, and public transport is nearly nonexistent ‚Äî buses come only once an hour. This means most people are only getting a few thousand steps a day. Not only does this lead to fewer calories burned, but being sedentary can mess with your food choices. When you‚Äôre not moving, your brain starts seeing food as pleasure, not fuel ‚Äî making overeating even more likely. Worst of all, this kind of inactivity is directly linked to higher risks of disease and death. While the community blames food, it became clear to me that the city itself is part of the problem.

To dig deeper, I knocked on doors and offered to cook people a healthy dinner. Unfortunately, I got no bites ‚Äî literally. Eventually, I met Santos and Samantha, who welcomed me in and opened up about their situation. They were never taught proper nutrition, their neighborhood has ~10 restaurants for every 1 gym, and local grocery stores don‚Äôt really sell fresh produce.

The next day, Kelly and I went grocery shopping with a goal: create a healthy, affordable meal that supports fat loss. We settled on chicken fajitas. To stay within budget, we bought in bulk, looked for sales, and used canned/frozen veggies ‚Äî which are not only cheaper, but often more nutritious than fresh ones. We got the cost down to $5 per person, and each fajita had just ~100 calories (compared to the 300-calorie versions from restaurants). They could eat three fajitas and still stay within a healthy calorie range. I even added a secret weapon: the seasoning from a delicious quesadilla I had on Day One. The owners were kind enough to share their spice blend to give our chicken some authentic Mexican flavor. To help Santos and Samantha continue this journey, we gave them access to the new BuiltWithScience+ app, with a meal scanner, at-home workouts, and custom nutrition plans. This could be a real new beginning for them.

On the day of the workshop, we prepped 40 bags of protein and over 120 meals... but with 15 minutes until showtime, no one had arrived.I started to wonder: Was all this for nothing? But instead of giving up, I took to the streets one last time to invite people in, hoping we could make even a small difference. This experience taught me that obesity is far more complex than most people realize. It‚Äôs not just about personal choice ‚Äî it‚Äôs about environment, education, access, and support. But what makes me hopeful are people like Santos and Samantha, and the countless others in McAllen who want to make a change, even in the face of massive obstacles. If even one obese person walks away from this with a better understanding of what‚Äôs really going on ‚Äî or takes that first step toward change ‚Äî then this trip was worth it.",0,416,306,8

In this video, I‚Äôll cover everything to know about using Ozempic for weight loss, from how it works to Ozempic‚Äôs side effects.

Here‚Äôs how Ozempic works for weight loss, as explained by Dr. Eric Trexler. It works by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which, after we consume food, it tells us, ‚ÄòHey, you're full, and it's time to stop eating.'  But it also rewires what your brain actually wants to eat. When you're on ozempic, those same calorie dense, really delicious foods, they just aren't quite as satisfying. What you find is individuals who have less cravings for those high calorie foods and ultimately end up opting for lower calorie foods.

Also, according to Dr. Spencer Nadolsky, America‚Äôs leading GLP-1 doctor and researcher, Ozempic might have benefits that extend far beyond just weight loss. Research found in those with a history of heart disease and obesity, it reduced more heart attacks than a placebo. People thought that it would be from the weight loss that you get from it, but they're actually these GLP-1 receptors all over the body and including the heart that it's thought that these drugs help reduce a lot of this risk of stuff through. 

But to be completely transparent with you, Dr. Spencer isn‚Äôt just familiar with the research on Ozempic, he prescribes it regularly. So if we‚Äôre going to be honest about its benefits, we should also be honest about Ozempic‚Äôs side effects.¬†

The first is ‚ÄúOzempic face‚Äù and ‚ÄúOzempic butt‚Äù. So when you lose a lot of weight, you‚Äôll see that ‚Äúsucked-in‚Äù look. These side effects are made even more visible when you combine muscle loss into the equation. On Ozempic, you still might struggle to eat anything at all. What do you think happens to your muscle? Your body quickly starts breaking it down.¬†Then, stack that on top of the other big problem: low energy. Because overeating becomes more difficult, Ozempic can unintentionally put you in a severe calorie deficit.¬† As a result, your workouts suffer. Another alarming, potential side effect is blindness. 

What happens to your body, and brain, when you stop taking Ozempic? Ozempic removes the part of ‚Äúyou‚Äù that makes you overweight.¬†But when you go off it, your old self is back. That‚Äôs why on average, after hopping off drugs like Ozempic, most people regain 2/3rd‚Äôs of the weight they lost within the first year. And this is why most patients end up staying on the drug indefinitely.

So many people, especially in the fitness industry, are against the idea of Ozempic. Ozempic gets you results without the suffering.¬†It is kind of like... ‚Äúcheating.‚Äù I without a doubt would have felt this way about Ozempic back when I was younger. But now, I understand something I didn‚Äôt back then.¬†Many people who are obese or overweight WANT to change.¬†Yes, obesity can be environmental, but obesity can also be, in many cases, genetic. So if you‚Äôre overweight and meet the criteria, Ozempic is a game changer.¬†But what if‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre healthy and just want to take ozempic to get leaner? The drug seems to be slowly making its way to the bodybuilding community. Is this bordering the line of abuse? Arguably, yes.¬†But what we define as ‚Äúabuse‚Äù of the drug I predict will very quickly change. It started as a treatment for diabetes.¬†And now it's being used for weight loss.¬†

In the future, I believe Ozempic, and a handful of drugs like it, will be used by many people.¬†Because Ozempic is a very special weight-loss drug that causes you to lose weight better than anything else out there, and, for now, doesn‚Äôt seem to be dangerous to your health, and if anything, will improve it.¬†Assuming you qualify for it, there is only one objective reason to not take ozempic right now.¬†Cost. It‚Äôs expensive.¬†But the primary patent protecting ozempic in the United States is expected to expire in December 2031. Shortly after that, I predict we‚Äôll not only start seeing cheaper Ozempic generics hit the market, but more effective ones.¬†I also predict the rules to qualify for the drug will be far more relaxed. And when that happens‚Ä¶. Who knows. Maybe Ozempic will become the new multivitamin. Maybe America will finally reverse its obesity epidemic and drop its average BMI back down to the global average.¬†

14:26 : How to Implement The Morning Routine

Without training harder or eating more protein, one of the best muscle building tips I can give is just improving your sleep. And the key to this is waking up at sunrise and getting morning sunlight to stimulate melatonin production. But if your sun doesn‚Äôt rise til later, you can still replicate this effect by investing in a light that provides at least 10,000 lux of brightness and filters out as much UV light as possible.

Next, a daily weigh-in ‚Äî right after waking up and after using the bathroom‚Äî during your morning routine is one of the best ways to track your muscle building progress. If you‚Äôre trying to build muscle, you should see your morning weight slowly creep up by about half a pound per week. Whereas if your goal is fat loss while building muscle, then your weight should stay relatively stable or drop slightly every week. 

Caffeine is one of the best morning muscle building habits you can use to boost focus, mood, and even your workouts. But timing is key. I prefer to have my caffeine as early as possible. For most people, caffeine has a half-life of about six hours. So for me, shortly after waking at 6 a.m. I‚Äôll have an Earl Grey tea (about 50 milligrams of caffeine). By 9 am, I‚Äôll have a scoop of our Built With Science pre-workout which contains 180mg of caffeine but also an added ingredient called L-Theanine which helps smooth out the energy boost and prevents the hard crash you usually get from taking that amount of caffeine on its own. After that, I avoid caffeine.

Next, training during your morning routine for muscle growth leads to a circadian ‚Äúphase advance‚Äù. If you‚Äôre used to training later in the day, you might notice that your lifts feel heavier and your performance takes a hit when you first switch to morning workouts. That‚Äôs completely normal. But the good news is, this is just temporary.

Next, a high-protein breakfast is the best breakfast for muscle growth. But how much is actually necessary? My recommendation is to aim for at least 20-30 grams of high-quality protein in your morning meal, then spread the rest of your daily intake across a few meals throughout the day. Here‚Äôs what I personally do. If I‚Äôm training first thing in the morning, I‚Äôll have a banana with 1 scoop of my Built With Science whey protein powder. After my workout is when I have my more satiating, slow digesting meal. This is usually either oatmeal topped with half a scoop of Built With Science protein powder and greek yogurt, or a sourdough bread sandwich with 4 whole eggs.

Lastly, cold exposure. Whether it‚Äôs a cold shower or ice bath, is believed to be a game-changer for muscle recovery, metabolism, and looking really, really cool on Instagram. The bad news is that while cold exposure immediately after a workout actually does seem to help you recover quicker, it does so by blunting the full recovery process, leading to less muscle growth and strength. It also hasn‚Äôt been shown to do anything notable for fat loss. So why do so many people love it? One reason is it definitely flips your nervous system into high gear, and you feel wide awake. 

For these reasons, I must admit I am a regular partaker in cold showers to naturally wake me up. But by cold showers I mean I take a really hot shower to warm up and then crank it cold for a few seconds and scream like a baby.

So here's my entire morning routine for muscle growth laid out for you. 

In bed by 9:30pm, asleep by 10:00pm
Wake up at 6:00am with morning daylight
Weigh myself while brushing my teeth
Earl grey tea + 1-2 hours of deep work
Protein shake + banana + pre-workout caffeine
Workout (weights or cardio)
Post-workout high protein breakfast",0,515,306,8

10:30 - How to Implement The Exercises

Out of the many bicep arm exercises, I started in the gym with standard bicep curls.¬†But here‚Äôs the problem. They challenge your biceps mostly in the middle position when your arm is flexed. This is a similar challenge your biceps already get from your back exercises. Plus, because the biceps cross all the way over the shoulder, exercises like dumbbell curls don't stretch your biceps as much as they could by exercises where your arm stays behind you. Which, at least based on research on other muscle groups, seems to be a powerful way to stimulate more growth.¬†
To discover the best exercise for your biceps, scientists from a brand new 2025 study ran an exercise comparison. They split participants into 2 groups. One group did only incline curls for 8 weeks, whereas the other group did preacher curls. Incline curls led to more growth in the upper part of the arm, but preacher curls led to more growth in the lower part of the arm!¬†Meaning?¬†Theoretically, to maximize growth in all parts of your biceps, you‚Äôd want an exercise where the challenge is hardest at the bottom but without the arm held in front of the body, so the biceps are more stretched. Fitness experts share 3 options when it comes to the best exercise for biceps: reverse preacher curls, flat bench dumbbell curls, and behind-the-body cable bicep curls.
But even with the best arm exercises for the bicep, your biceps only contribute about a third of your arm size. The other two-thirds? The triceps.¬†Unfortunately, most people use arm exercises ‚Äî like pushdowns, close-grip presses, or dips ‚Äî that don‚Äôt allow this muscle to reach its full potential. Those arm exercises primarily work just 2 parts of the triceps: the lateral head and the medial head. Which are what beef up the triceps from the front and side.But the third head, the long head, is the biggest part of the triceps and beefs them up from the back and hangs down when you flex your arms. So, what‚Äôs the better option?
To find out which tricep exercise would yield bigger arms, Scientists from a 2022 study had subjects perform overhead extensions with one arm and pushdowns with the other arm for 12 weeks. Now, because the long head crosses over the shoulder, whenever you do a triceps exercise with your arm overhead, this muscle gets stretched, which, as you know by now, seems to boost growth in certain muscles.¬†But surprisingly, all 3 heads grew more with the overhead extensions, resulting in 1.4x more overall triceps growth than the pushdowns.¬†Now, we don‚Äôt yet know why the other 2 heads grew more, and we could definitely use another study to confirm these findings, but the researchers used MRI, which is the gold standard of measurement, so the study is strong.¬† This is also why every single expert I spoke to chose the overhead extension as their #1 triceps exercise.
Alberto prefers the overhead tricep extension with a rope. Daniel likes the overhead tricep extension with a cable, usually with his hand wrapped through the D handle and elbow propped up.¬†Which variation should you choose? What you‚Äôre looking for is a variation where you feel very little to no pain in your elbows or shoulders as you do it, yet feel a great pump in your triceps after you finish your set. 
As for how to implement these arm exercises in your arms workout in the gym, while other arm exercises are still great and can help grow your arms, for the best results, you‚Äôll wanna do these 2 specific movements for 3 sets of 10-15 reps at least 1-2 times per week.",1,967,306,8

Lyrics
I got Chanel No.5
He‚Äôll never survive 
It‚Äôs a crime, it‚Äôs a crime
He watch when I whine
I know, I know, it‚Äôs a crime
I know what he likes, a cat eye, a black dress
It‚Äôs just a reminder
I‚Äôm seeing desire arise in his eyes
So, lucky for them

Cute girl with a sick mind
I know just how to play my cards right
Wrist, wrist, spritz, spritz 
Make him come alive
Chanel No.5

If I want him, he‚Äôs all mine
I know just how to fuck with his mind
Wrist, wrist, spritz, spritz
Make him come alive
Chanel No.5

Fold for me like origami
Magic and real like murakami 
Red chipped nails, I‚Äôm wabi sabi
I‚Äôm the heartbreaker, nobody‚Äôs got me, yet

Make you tongue tied like new shibari
Subtle and complex like umami
Up to me like omakase
I‚Äôm a wild horse and nobody‚Äôs got me, yet

Shouldn‚Äôt trust it that I want you baby
Cause I love you, love-you-not like daisies 
But this gloss I got is cute and tasty
She‚Äôs an extra, I‚Äôm your leading lady 

Cute girl with a sick mind
I know just how to play my cards right
Wrist, wrist, spritz, spritz
Make him come alive
Chanel No.5

If I want him, he‚Äôs all mine
I know just how to fuck with his mind
Wrist, wrist, spritz, spritz 
Make him come alive
Chanel No.5

I‚Äôm a dog,
Woof woof
And my tooth is getting long
Imma hog the mic, take a bite, peek-a-boo thong
I just ugh, I just what, I‚Äôm just writing all my wrongs
Now I‚Äôm high rise, sky high, like I‚Äôm king kong

I got violence like Tarantino
Wearing all pink, all Valentino
Sparkle in his mouth like Pellegrino
I‚Äôm a real problem, he doesn‚Äôt know it yet

Shouldn‚Äôt trust it that I want you baby, 
Cause I love you, love-you-not like daisies 
But this gloss I got is cute and tasty 
She‚Äôs an extra, I‚Äôm your leading lady 

Cute girl with a sick mind
I know just how to play my cards right
Wrist, wrist, spritz, spritz 
Make him come alive

If I want him, he‚Äôs all mine
I know just how to fuck with his mind
Wrist, wrist, spritz, spritz
Make him come alive

Lying in bed
Replaying the shit you said
Ever regret all the messing with my head?
 
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôve been thinking
You‚Äôd never give me peace of mind, so I had to give it to myself
You never think it‚Äôs the right time until I‚Äôm good with someone else
You‚Äôd probably have me for a lifetime, if you didn‚Äôt need some help
I wish,
I wish,
I wish you‚Äôd say
 
You were right
That I want you when you‚Äôre not mine
And just when I think I know how to live without you
I forget why I try
 
You were right
And I fucked up, baby, big time
And just when I think I could fall in love without you
I forget why I try
You were the best of all time
 
Texts I won‚Äôt send
We both know how that shit ends
Trying again
Too jealous to just be friends
 
‚ÄòCuz now I‚Äôm thinking
You‚Äôd never ask me who I‚Äôm giving all of my body to now
You never ask me ‚Äòbout these nights,
Baby I pray that you find out
You couldn‚Äôt give me your heart, boy
Go and eat your heart out
 
I wish you‚Äôd say
You were right
That I want you when you‚Äôre not mine
And just when I think I know how to live without you
I forget why I try
 
You were right
And I fucked up, baby, big time
And just when I think I could fall in love without you
I forget why I try
You were the best of all time

Lyrics
We used to kick it up at the park
Now she‚Äôs all grown up
Rockin them stilettos
Jumpin‚Äô out that Mercedes truck
 
It was Keisha, it was Sonia, it was Tanya, it was Monique
It was Niecy, it was Keke
Now you see her at 26, all you can say is‚Ä¶
And I think she knows she‚Äôs the shit
Shawty is the shit
 
Mini dress, low key with the cap down
No heels cause she came to throw that ass around
Bodyodyodyody ‚Äòcuz she work out
Brought the Fuji to Uchi, fuck a phone out
 
Tan lines, white wine for the burn out
Worldwide but she‚Äôs reppin‚Äô for the hometown
Flew the girls to Bahamas for a night out
It‚Äôs a short life, so we‚Äôre going all out
 
Play some 2000s
There on shuffle
Makes me think of us in ‚Äò08
Mmmm, takes me back to the days
 
It was Keisha, it was Sonia, it was Tanya, it was Monique
It was Niecy, it was Keke
Now you see her at 26, all you can say is‚Ä¶
 
Yeah I think she knows she‚Äôs the shit
Yeah, shawty next to me is the shit, the shit
Shawty is the shit, the shit,
Always been the shit, the shit
Shawty is the - mmmm
 
She got stamina
Gas her up
She posin‚Äô posin‚Äô posin‚Äô
Camera
Watch ‚Äòem curves, drive it
Slow, ride it
 
Play some 2000s
There on shuffle
Makes me think of us in ‚Äò08
 
It takes me back to the days
It was Keisha, it was Sonia, it was Tanya, it was Monique
It was Niecy, it was Keke
Now you see her at 26, all you can say is‚Ä¶
 
Yeah I think she knows she‚Äôs the shit
Yeah, shawty next to me is the shit, the shit
Shawty is the shit, the shit
Always been the shit, the shit
Shawty is the - mmmm
 
For all the girls that are learning to be women now,
Know we keep it sexy while we figure it out
 
You know who it is making the world go ‚Äòround
This one‚Äôs for the girls, if you didn‚Äôt know - well ya know now
 
We‚Äôre learning to be women now
Know we keep it sexy while we figure it out
 
You know who it is that makes the world go ‚Äòround
If you didn‚Äôt know ‚Äì well ya know now

Lyrics
I don‚Äôt wanna be at this party anymore
I don‚Äôt think your jokes sound funny anymore
All these shoes I can‚Äôt dance in, what for?
Let me let this out, barefoot on the floor
 
And they‚Äôre gonna say I should probably up the meds
That some things should‚Äôve stayed in my head
I‚Äôm tired of playing pretend 
Stop driving, it‚Äôs a dead end
 
We‚Äôre living in a ghost world
We‚Äôre living in a past life
If everything could stay the same
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice?
But you know me, you know me, I-  
 
Always know just when to leave
When the night is past its peak
And I hope you find some peace
Godspeed 
 
Peace is so elusive
Joy is so elusive
Kisses to my muses
Truces for the bruises 
I got real life angels
Got me when I lose it
If I gotta burn a bridge
They‚Äôll help me light the fuses 
 
Sometimes I just lose it
Thoughts can be abusive
Times where I lose sight of love, the real reason I do this
15 since I do this
26, I choose this
 
We‚Äôre living in a ghost world
We‚Äôre living in a past life
If everything could stay the same
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice?
 
But you know me, you know me, I-  
Always know just when to leave
When the night is past its peak 
And I hope you find some peace
 
Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
Godspeed
 
I let you go and I feel more like me
I wish you well, but far away from me
Godspeed 
Godspeed

Lyrics
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Got bitches showing ass on Collins
Got bitches shaking ass on Collins
(Show that ass)
 
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Got bitches showing ass on Collins
Got bitches shaking ass on Collins
(Show that ass)
 
Skyline, lighting up her makeup
South Beach, see the city, wake up
Cuban girl, ink and new nails done
Everybody look ‚Äòcause she caked up
Wow
 
Celebrate the break up
Rude boy, come and meet your maker
And I‚Äôm rude too, I can take ya
Paying off the ‚ÄòTessie with a paystub 
Wow
 
Dade County dreaming
Head out the sunroof, girls are screaming 
Back to scheming 
Sure know how to give, but she love receiving 
 
Can you blame us?
Party in the city that raised us
Party like I forgot I was famous
Whine on him like I‚Äôm nameless
Woah
 
Yung Miami 
City Girls, XOXO
I‚Äôm from the city where the streets ain‚Äôt pretty 
Opa-locks where the goons get it poppin
On the ave 
D boys with the dickies
Big chevy with the big wheels choppin
I know I‚Äôm young but I‚Äôve seen a lot
I‚Äôm a bitch that these boss ***** dream about
Getting to the bag
What my team about
***** open up the safe, let me clean you out
 
This pussy get ate 
Cause my wrist game
Had to slap a broke bitch on Biscayne
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Real city girl shit, get it poppin‚Äô
Got bitches showing ass on Collins
Got bitches shaking ass on Collins
Ass clap
Up down
Left right
Fuck it up
Dick game soft
Go home
*****
Pack it up
Chanel 
Big bags
Real bitch
Stack it up
Chrome Hearts  
Pop tags
Ass fat 
Back it up
 
Real Miami girls get it poppin‚Äô
C and City Girls Benz hoppin‚Äô‚Äô
C and City Girls, out shopping
Real Miami girls, club hopping
 
Got a high rise view on Collins
Baby we could hide out on Collins
Drop ‚Äòem all when I come calling
Real Miami girls on Collins
 
Dade County Dreaming
Head out the sunroof, girls are screaming
Back to scheming
Sure know how to give, but she love receiving
 
Girl loves the feeling
Life in her eyes, everything‚Äôs fleeting
I can‚Äôt feel the ceiling
Orange skies, I‚Äôm never leaving

Lyrics 
Imma call you, Imma hit your number
Imma slow whine and make you wonder
Fantasies about you in my head
I know that we shouldn‚Äôt, but- 
 
Can friends kiss?
Touch each other like this?
Undercover like this?
Little too close, play a Popcaan song
And my mind is gone like this
 
Teasin‚Äô on you like this
Put it on you like this
Little too close
Play a Konshens song 
And my mind is gone like this 
 
I don‚Äôt like your new girl, she don‚Äôt move me
When you talk about her, I get moody
VVS1 icin‚Äô out my neck
I want it to drip drip on your lips
 
Come party
Come touch my body
I‚Äôm a busy body
Tick tick tick tick 
 
Come find me
Come get behind me
 
Come party
Come touch my body
I‚Äôm a busy body
Tick tick tick tick 
 
Come find me
Come get behind me
 
Baby, can friends kiss?
Touch each other like this?
Undercover like this?
Little too close, play a Popcaan song
And my mind is gone like this
 
Teasin‚Äô on you like this
Put it on you like this
Little too close
Play a Konshens song 
And my mind is gone like this 
 
Go lock the door
Fall in love with me, I‚Äôm bored
We both know I‚Äôm yours 
I can‚Äôt do it anymore
 
This blue chiffon, off off off, need it gone
More radikon
And it goes on and on 
 
Can friends kiss?
Touch each other like this?
Undercover like this?
Little too close, play a Popcaan song
And my mind is gone like this
 
Teasin‚Äô on you like this
Put it on you like this
Little too close
Play a Konshens song 
And my mind is gone like this

Matt was a popular boy going into high school but quickly became isolated & depressed, experimenting with drugs was no solution so Matt attempted suicide. He awoke in hospital as a paraplegic with brain injuries and has now turned his life around and become a sought-after speaker at High schools around Australia on the subject of depression in youth. You can find out more about Matt via his website www.mattcaruana.com

From the writer/director ""When I 1st met Matt he was after a short promo film for his website but his story deserved so much more than that - it was an inspirational story that needed to be told properly. It's been a delight to bring this short film to an audience through festivals around the world and we'll now aim at creating a feature-length version""

In this epic Delhi to Pune road trip, we take the legendary Porsche 911 and the all-electric Porsche Macan EV across some of India‚Äôs best and toughest roads.

Starting from the Porsche Centre in Gurugram, we drive all the way to Jaisalmer, tackle the high-speed stretches of the Bharatmala Highway, stop by the iconic Statue of Unity ‚Äî the tallest statue in the world ‚Äî and continue through Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar before reaching our home base in Pune.

This isn‚Äôt just a road trip. It‚Äôs the ultimate India test for these Porsches ‚Äî from arrow-straight expressways to rough roads riddled with potholes and roadworks. Can the 911 and Macan EV live up to their badge on real Indian highways?

Watch the full video now to see how the 911's precision handling and the Macan EV‚Äôs electric performance handle everything from scorching deserts to city chaos, as we celebrate Porsche Day with the most ambitious drive yet.

üé§ Speaker: Dr. Sabeel Ahmed
üóìÔ∏è April 2025

In this powerful interfaith encounter, a Christian professor brings his missionary-minded students to the MCC Mosque in Chicago to witness the Friday prayer, listen to the khutbah (sermon), and engage in an open Q&A session with Dr. Sabeel Ahmed.
The students ask bold, honest questions about Islam, the Quran, Muslim prayer, and whether the Bible has been changed, sparking thoughtful responses grounded in knowledge and mutual respect.

‚ú® A must-watch for anyone interested in comparative religion, interfaith dialogue, and the search for truth.

This is my full special which was released on insider in Dec 2023 on a pay per view basis. Thank you to everyone who bought tickets for the special then. It was my first time experimenting with the business model of releasing a comedy special online & your support helped us in producing this with our own money. Now after almost 2 years of shooting this I am releasing the whole show on Youtube for everyone to watch & enjoy. Hope you all like it :)

‚ÄúAngry Young Man‚Äù is Aakash Gupta‚Äôs first hour-long standup comedy special. Frustrated and grumpy about things he sees and feels, the comedian who is always asked, ‚ÄúTu hasta kyu nahi?‚Äù expresses his annoyance through humorous stories about life, from school days, to his recent trip to Europe. Some of you may have seen this show live in your city and now you can watch it again, online with your friends and loved ones. If you have not watched him before, don't worry, here is your chance to experience this hilarious show in HD.

With his agitated and ranting style of comic delivery, brace yourself as you laugh your socks off at the ‚ÄúAngry Young Man‚Äù.

For about 15 years, big-budget Nintendo games cost $60. In fact, that was the standard game price across the industry. Meanwhile, Nintendo‚Äôs consoles are generally cheaper than most competing gaming systems, such as the Xbox and the PlayStation. Its consoles have never cost more than $300‚Ä¶until now.

At $450, the Switch 2 is Nintendo‚Äôs priciest console. And Mario Kart World is priced at $80 ‚Äî the most expensive base game Nintendo has ever released. Some fans are outraged by the price increase. But some industry analysts say that it‚Äôs time for games to be more expensive, considering the rising costs of game development and inflation, among other factors.

So, why is Nintendo suddenly so expensive? And what does an $80 game mean for Nintendo and the entire video game industry?

The Emerald Tablet is a legendary ancient text, often attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a figure also known as Thoth. While it's presented as a foundational work of alchemy and magic, its actual origin and historical context are debated. The text, which includes the famous phrase ""As above, so below,"" has been seen as a summary of alchemical principles and a guide to the secrets of the philosopher's stone.

THE TERROR OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE IS ASLEEP.
WE THINK WE'RE AWAKE AND WE'RE WALKING AROUND IN THE WORLD, BUT WE'RE  STILL FAST ASLEEP AND WE JUST KEEP PLAYING OUT THE SAME REACTIVE PSYCHOLOGIC PATTERNS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
Man is immersed in dreams... He lives in sleep‚Ä¶ He is a machine. He cannot stop the flow of his thoughts, he cannot control his imagination, his emotions, his attention... He does not see the real world. The real world is hidden from him by the wall of imagination.

The roads, the homestay, the people‚Äîeverything felt like ours. But goodbyes are never easy. The road called, and we had to move on‚Ä¶ with a quiet promise to return.

Then came the unexpected. A deviation. A road leading us deep into isolation‚Äîfar from the highway, far from civilization. Just a lorry passing by, and then‚Ä¶ silence. The kind that makes you aware of every sound, every shadow, every turn. Sometimes, Google Maps takes you places you never imagined. And trust me, this was one of them.

But every ride has its purpose, and ours led us to something extraordinary‚Äîthe Mawphlang Sacred Forest. A place steeped in history, guarded by age-old traditions, and filled with an energy you can feel the moment you step in. The journey to get there wasn‚Äôt easy, but the first glimpse of this sacred land made it all worth it.

With poetic, personal reflections, Eddie reminds you that real fulfillment is found in the messiness of growth, in the falls, the breaks, and the rebuilds. If you‚Äôve ever felt stuck in the life you‚Äôve created, this episode will urge you to let go of what‚Äôs comfortable, take the chance, and make the choice to live courageously.

We journey to the Salt River at sunrise, drawing on the wisdom of the wild horses and the Stoic philosophy to remind us that peace doesn‚Äôt come from fighting the current, but from flowing with it. 

We reflect on the importance of protecting our energy, of pouring ourselves into what inspires us, and of finding the courage to be different.

We talk about the power of holding on when the world would let go, and how, like the river and the rising sun, we‚Äôre always invited to begin again. Let this episode be your call to trust your path, to move with the current where you must, and to shape your life with unwavering purpose; this is your moment to rise.

What You‚Äôll Discover:

Why the voices telling you to stay small aren‚Äôt your truth

The cost of ignoring the flicker of potential inside you

How to spot the silent killer of self-sabotage

The difference between comfort and growth, and why you can‚Äôt have both

Why aiming for ‚Äúsafe‚Äù is the biggest risk of all

Eddie‚Äôs words cut through the noise, reminding you that playing small doesn‚Äôt protect you, it slowly steals everything you could become. If you‚Äôve felt stuck, if you‚Äôve felt like life‚Äôs slipping by while you wait for the ‚Äúright‚Äù moment, this is your call to action.

In this episode, I share one of the most intense physical and mental journeys I've ever experienced, a brutal, beautiful workout guided by the quiet force behind some of the greatest transformations in fitness and life: Eric, the trainer behind David Goggins' infamous ‚Äúwho‚Äôs gonna carry the boats?‚Äù moment.

But this story doesn‚Äôt end with muscle fatigue. It expands into something deeper.

üåÄ Alongside that journey, I‚Äôm layering in three new speeches that explore:

üí° Creative courage ‚Äî Why you must be brave enough to make things that might fail

‚ö° Emotional polarity ‚Äî Why it‚Äôs better to be loved or hated than ignored

üîÅ The paradox of purpose ‚Äî How the things we fear (like failure) are often the exact things that shape us

This episode isn‚Äôt about being strong. It‚Äôs about being honest. About walking to the edge of yourself ‚Äî physically, creatively, emotionally ‚Äî and letting go of the illusion of control.

üî• You‚Äôll hear:

The meaning of ""Earning Your Failure"" ‚Äî and why it‚Äôs sacred

What creative bravery really looks like

Why attention is power ‚Äî and how indifference is the true enemy

How embracing paradox reveals purpose

Let yourself fall. Let yourself break. And then‚Ä¶ rise.
This one‚Äôs for anyone standing at the edge of their potential.

In August 2024, a friend and I flew to Germany, picked up 2 Triumph motorcycles - a Bonneville T120 and a Scrambler 1200x - and went on a summer roadtrip across borders exploring Germany, Austria, Slovenia and parts of Northern Italy. We set off from MaxlRain in Germany with a pretty bare bones plan, and let our route shape itself based on recommendations from people that we met along the way and spontaneous decisions made along the way. Was that the right way to go about a motorcycle trip like this one? Well, watch the video to find out more!

A huge shout out to Triumph Munich for hooking us up with these gorgeous motorcycles.

Mr. Siva is extremely passionate about the products that are created under his watch and he was up for me to document a part of our conversation so that I could share it with all of you. The detailed answers that came up during this conversation provide a deeper understanding about all that goes into the development of the tyres that we use, as well as several tips to help make better decisions and choices. This is a long video, but I would urge you to watch it through to the end, because this information is extremely useful to anyone who shares the passion for a life on 2 wheels.

I haven't yet had a chance to ride on the Amalfi Coast or the Great Ocean Road, but Vietnam's Coastal Roads should definitely be on the bucket list of anyone who loves a road trip by the ocean.

or checkout our other courses: https://www.xelplus.com/courses

Still getting annoying zeros or blank rows when referencing entire columns in Excel?
üö´ Say goodbye to messy formulas and complicated workarounds.
‚úÖ Just add a dot (.) ‚Äî Technically called Trim References / Trim Refs - or use the new TRIMRANGE function ‚Äî and Excel will automatically clean up your dynamic ranges. So you can finally reference the full column (ok. you probably should still stick to a range or better an Excel table if possible)

üîó Get my Practice File here: https://pages.xelplus.com/trimrange-file

00:00 Introducing the New Excel TRIMRANGE Function
00:59 How to Use the Dot: Trim Refs in Excel
03:14 How to Use TRIMRANGE Function
04:15 Clean Unique Lists Without Zeros Using TRIMRANGE or Dot
05:01 Combine Data Across Sheets with VSTACK + TRIMRANGE
07:27 Get the Last 12 Months of Data with TAKE
09:17 Wrap Up

Availability: Excel for Microsoft 365 - TRIMRANGE is generally available.

In this video, you‚Äôll discover:
- How the dot operator (Trim Refs) instantly removes trailing and leading empty cells
- How TRIMRANGE automatically expands/contracts with your data ‚Äî no more OFFSET or INDEX hacks
- A cleaner way to create dynamic lists, charts, and reports
- How to combine data across sheets without dragging blank rows along
- The modern, simple formula to get the last 12 months of data
- When to use TRIMRANGE vs. Excel Tables (and why you might switch depending on the task)

TRIMRANGE is a game-changer. It automatically detects the actual cell range your data lives in ‚Äî and grows or shrinks with it. No more writing dynamic named ranges. No more formula frustration.

Even better: The new dot operator is a shorthand for TRIMRANGE. Just add a dot after your column reference, and Excel handles the cleanup for you.

üåø I started my morning with a refreshing Amla (Gooseberry) drink ‚Äì watch how I prepare it and learn some amazing health benefits of this superfood! ü•ó After that, I made some simple and nutritious salads, spent some quality time with my little angel, and enjoyed some peaceful family moments.

üçõ In the afternoon, I cooked Bisibele Bath ‚Äì but with a twist! I used ingredients from Sampoorna, a brand I'm proud to support. These products are made by a wonderful group of women from our own Karnataka. The taste and quality are absolutely amazing, and I‚Äôve been using them for a few months now. Watch as I show you how easy and flavorful the cooking process is with Sampoorna!

üíõ Before signing off, I‚Äôm sharing a few heartfelt thoughts ‚Äì a reminder that life is beautiful, and with positivity and strength, we can overcome anything.

üë∂ And finally, a special treat! As many of you requested, I‚Äôve added a few cute and candid clips of my baby girl's fun moments at the end of the video. Don‚Äôt miss them!

In a fiery escalation, Donald Trump has issued a cryptic but forceful statement suggesting that Elon Musk could face ‚Äúvery serious consequences.‚Äù While Trump didn‚Äôt name Musk directly, sources and political watchers believe this is tied to Musk‚Äôs criticism of Trump‚Äôs ICE raid tactics, troop deployment in Los Angeles, and control over free speech via social media platforms.

As protests rage across California and SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), and Tesla remain key players in the socio-political and economic fabric, Trump‚Äôs comments have ignited a media firestorm. Will Musk retaliate? Is Trump using the Insurrection Act to send a broader warning to billionaires and dissenters?

1. Should You Cut Hair Before Chemotherapy?
Many people choose to cut their hair short before starting chemotherapy to make hair loss less distressing.

A short haircut can make shedding less noticeable and help with emotional adjustment. Some even shave their heads when hair starts falling out to avoid dealing with patchy hair loss.

2. How to Manage Hair During Chemotherapy?
Be gentle with hair: Use a soft brush and mild, sulfate-free shampoo.
Avoid heat styling: No blow-drying, straightening, or curling.
No chemical treatments: Avoid hair dyes, bleach, or perms.
Use a silk pillowcase: Reduces friction and hair breakage.

3. Will Hair Grow Back After Chemotherapy?
Yes, hair usually starts growing back 3‚Äì6 weeks after chemotherapy ends.
Initially, new hair may be softer, curlier, or a different color before returning to normal. Some people experience permanent thinning or texture changes.

4. Head Covering Options
Wigs: Can be matched to your natural hair before chemotherapy.
Scarves & caps: Protect the scalp from cold and sun exposure.
Cooling caps: Some use scalp cooling systems to reduce hair loss, but results vary.",0,424,692,0

Blood donation zarur karna chahiye.

Blood donation has numerous benefits, both for the donor and for those in need. Here are some key advantages:

Health Benefits for the Donor:

Improves Heart Health ‚Äì Reduces the risk of heart disease by lowering excessive iron levels in the blood, which can cause oxidative damage.

Enhances Blood Flow ‚Äì Regular blood donation helps in maintaining healthy blood viscosity, reducing clot formation.

Stimulates Blood Cell Production ‚Äì The body replenishes the lost blood, leading to the production of new, healthy blood cells.

Lowers Cancer Risk ‚Äì Reducing iron stores in the body may lower the risk of certain cancers, including liver, lung, colon, and throat cancers.

Aids in Weight Management ‚Äì Each blood donation burns approximately 650 calories.

Provides a Free Health Check-up ‚Äì Before donating, you receive a mini health check, including blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, and potential infections.
Benefits for Recipients and Society:

Saves Lives ‚Äì One donation can save up to three lives by providing whole blood, plasma, or platelets for different medical needs.

Supports Patients with Chronic Diseases ‚Äì Essential for cancer patients, anemic individuals, and those undergoing major surgeries or accidents.

Assists in Disaster and Emergency Situations ‚Äì Helps maintain blood banks for emergencies, including natural disasters and accidents.

Encourages Community Support and Awareness ‚Äì Promotes the habit of giving and raises awareness about the importance of voluntary blood donation.",0,250,692,0

Hope you guys enjoy the video :)

My few thoughts on the game: 
I love it. Despite having very little content as of now, I had a blast driving in this game. Keep in mind the game is in early access. If given enough time and the same freedom to modders as in AC1, I'm pretty sure that this will be one of the biggest games in sim racing history. It looks fantastic, the cars sound amazing. I have very few complaints... FFB feels good but not like AC1 where we never even had to adjust the default settings. This isn't the same. Once you dial it in, it's pretty good. But there is definitely room for improvement. I couldn't feel the limit at which the cars starts to understeer. Also felt like when the rear starts to slide, the counter steering forces came a bit too late causing spin outs way more often than we expect. This may be fixed with the ffb settings but so far I had no luck. Other than this, it is a good driving experience. Can't wait for multiplayer and free roam... Exciting times!!! Let me know what you guys think about Assetto Corsa EVO.

Gavin Newsom condemned the move as ‚Äúpurposefully inflammatory‚Äù.   It comes after three days of protests against immigration raids in the city. 

The Los Angeles Police Department have said the protests are largely peaceful and the LA authorities said they could handle the situation.

National Guard troops have been stationed outside the Metropolitan detention centre, one of several sites that have seen confrontations involving hundreds of demonstrators and federal law enforcement officials.

It‚Äôs the first time a US president has deployed the National Guard in the face of civil unrest since the LA riots in 1992.   President Trump said: ‚ÄúWe'll send whatever we need to make sure there's law and order.‚Äù

However Mr Trump‚Äôs Democrat opponents have said the administration's use of masked immigration officers with military gear to arrest civilians in restaurants and shops has been inflammatory and the president's eagerness to deploy trained soldiers was unwarranted.

Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Austrian World Summit, organised by the Schwarzenegger's Climate Initiative, he said the US President could not prevent progress on tackling the threat of global warming. 

Donald Trump has reversed many US initiatives to support the environment and pulled out of international agreements to tackle climate change. 

However Mr Schwarzenegger said the question for people was:  ‚ÄúWhat do you do?  We all have a responsibility.  You think action comes only for the whole world out of Washington, the White House?‚Äù

He said people needed to understand the obstacles to change but not use them as an excuse for inaction.

Five years ago, I visited Mogadishu (Somalia) and experienced one of the most intense places I‚Äôve ever been. The city felt scary, unpredictable, and deeply wounded by decades of conflict, and to this day, I‚Äôve considered Mogadishu the most dangerous city on Earth.

So, why did I get the urge to come back?

Because I wanted to see what has changed. Is Mogadishu healing? Are things getting better? And most importantly, what do the Somali people have to say about their own future?

In this video, I return to Somalia‚Äôs capital not just to walk its streets again, but to connect with locals, ask tough questions, and share their voices with the world. This is a story of resilience, change, and hope in one of the planet‚Äôs most misunderstood cities.

Huge thanks to Young Pioneer Tours for arranging my trip and keeping me safe! If you want to visit Mogadishu, I highly recommend going with them! Book on this link: https://www.youngpioneertours.com/mogadishu-somalia-tours/

I have a love-hate relationship with India after spending 6 months of my life in the country. But if one thing is for sure, India has taught me more about myself and the world than any other place I've been.  I hope you will watch this entire video so you can understand why I think everyone should travel to India at least once in their lives!

I welcome your thoughts, opinions, and comments in the description down below -- what do you like or dislike about India? And do you have any travel-related questions about traveling to India? I'll be reading and responding to your comments - thank you!

Describe a happy family event from your childhood. 
You should say: 
what the event was, where it happened: A happy family event that I still remember clearly from my childhood was making chung cake for Tet holiday at my grandparents‚Äô house. (0:25)
what you saw and did: When I was small, our family would get together to make chung cake for Tet holiday. My grandparents had six children; therefore, I had many cousins. And the great thing was that my cousins and I were around the same age. At that time, we were too small to do anything, so basically, we played with each other while we watched the adults prepare the ingredients for the cake. (1:06)
Sometimes, we got to eat the leftover food after all the cakes were finished. Tet holiday was the only time of the year that we were allowed to stay up late, one reason why it is so memorable. Although the winter was cold, we all felt cozy inside; we had so much fun together.(1:35)
and explain why you remember this event so well: Since my grandfather passed away a couple of years ago, we stopped our family tradition. In addition, some of my cousins had already gotten married and had their own families, and some had gone to study abroad. Consequently, it was very difficult for us to get together like old times. Missing this special family tradition makes it so unforgettable for me and I hope we can start doing it again in the future.(2:14)

US President Donald Trump stumbled on the stairs of Air Force One on Sunday (Jun 8) ahead of departure from Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, New Jersey. Trump was heading to Camp David. The tumble has left the internet in stitches, with some comparing it to the incident when ex-president Joe Biden suffered a similar fate. Not just Mr Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio also stumbled as he boarded Air Force One.

Start Here: http://streamingclub.co 

Being a law of attraction coach, I wanted to personally purchase this program before I recommended it to any students or friends. I had heard about this for some time and felt like maybe I didn't need it at the moment. Boy was I wrong. I started with Six Minutes To Success, then took personal coaching, and now that I have streaming club, I would say if you are on a budget that this is your best buy for the money. 
This was always talked about as I was taking coaching and I just wasn't ready at the time for it. Now that I have it, I can't believe everything you get for the price. It was clear to me that there would be a 1 hour live stream with Bob once a week, but what I didn't know or realize was that you also get access to every live stream ever recorded (5 years back) so over 1,000 videos. On top of that, you get access to bonus downloads that we had when I was in the coaching program that cost wayyyyy more than you will pay for a year of streaming club. Yes we got a little more and more in depth, but for the price, this is a gold mine in my eyes. I could be jaded as I love Bob, but if I step back and compare it to other programs I have gone through, then this will win. 
So if you are a student or part of the free 30 day coaching program and you would like to know if this is worth the money to buy, hands down I would say yes. If you apply yourself, you will gain an immense amount from this program. I personally highly recommend it and will continue to use it myself as well.

Improving your sales skills is the best way to grow your business and increase your income. I just got back from Orlando Florida where I had the opportunity to watch legendary salesman Jordan Belfort. Jordan Belfort is the person who inspired the movie the Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan became the best selling stock salesman of all time during the late 90's in New York. Now he travels the world teaching sales training to people interested in improving their sales skills and making more money.

I recently took a trip to the beautiful Hawaiian Islands and had an opportunity to read a lot of books and reflect of life in general.  While reading the book The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace Wattles I started to think about the subject of setting goals.  Over the years I have heard dozens of self-improvement gurus talk about the importance of setting big goals.  I think a lot of people are afraid to set really large goals in their life because they don't think they can achieve them, but the reality is if you don't set big goals you will never achieve big things.  The law of attraction says that what you focus on you will manifest into your life.  The simple act of focusing on achieving big things will always deliver some level of success to you even if you don't achieve your ultimate goal.  Im this video I break down my top 3 reasons to set super large goals in your life and work diligently towards their attainment.

It is not the absence of longing, but the soft presence of peace amidst it. To be mutma‚Äôeen is to rest in the heart‚Äôs own knowing, to breathe without needing answers, and to carry calm like a companion. In a world built on urgency, mutma‚Äôeen arrives like dusk‚Äîunhurried, whole, and luminous.

In this episode of Urdunama, we sit with the word mutma‚Äôeen, tracing how poets have expressed calm, surrender, and soulful contentment in their verses. Join us as we explore how poetry teaches us to be still, even when the world won‚Äôt.

#delhidemolition  #MadrasiCampDemolition #groundreport  #bulldozeraction  #delhi 

On June 1, a demolition drive was carried out in Madrasi Camp, located adjacent to the Barapula drain in the Jangpura area of Delhi. Acting on the orders of the Delhi High Court, authorities demolished 370 slum dwellings. The action was taken as part of efforts to ""clean and widen"" the Barapula drain ahead of the monsoon season and to prevent waterlogging in the area.

However, residents who have been living in Madrasi Camp for several decades claim they were promised housing under the ""Jahan Jhuggie, Wahin Makaan"" (homes where the slums are) scheme during past elections. They are now expressing strong resentment, accusing the BJP-led Delhi administration of going back on its word.

In this ground report, we look at the current situation in Madrasi Camp. How are the displaced residents reacting to the bulldozer action? What are their demands and expectations moving forward?

This is the easiest and only recipe you‚Äôll need to make the most delicious ginger pickle. 

Ingredients- 
7-8 tbsp oil 
100g Ginger 
8 Garlic pods 
1/2 tsp Menthulu 
1.5 tbsp Jeera 
2 tsp Mustard seeds
100g dried Red Chilli 
100g tamarind water (soaked for 2-3 hours) 
200g jaggery or bellam

Tempering or Popu - 
6-7 tbsp oil 
10 small Garlic pods
1.5 tbsp Senaga pappu
1.5 tbsp Sai minapappu 
2 tsp Mustard seeds 
5 Dried Chilli 
Small bunch Curry leaves 


To start off, chop 100g ginger into small pieces. In a pan with a few table spoons of oil, add the ginger pieces and stir for a few minutes until they brown a little. Drain the oil and keep them aside. 

In the same oil, add 10 chopped garlic pods. Saut√© for 30 seconds and add 1.5 tbsp Jeera or cumin seeds, 2 tsp menthulu of fenugreek, 2 tsp mustard seeds and stir this for 30 seconds. 

Add 100g dried red Chilli and stir this for 30 seconds to a minute or until the chillies turn into a deeper red colour. Drain the entire mixture and keep it aside. 
Let the mixture cool a little. 

One they‚Äôre cooled, add the ginger to a blender followed by the Chilli mixture. 
Add 3-4 tsp of salt, 100g of tamarind that‚Äôs been soaking in water for 2-3 hours and blitz this a few times. 
Add a few tbsp water, stir well and blitz again until it becomes a fine paste. 

Now add 200g of jaggery or Bellam, mix well and blitz again until it‚Äôs all well combined. 

Transfer this to a bowl and leave it aside until we do the next step. 

For the tempering or Popu, we need 10 garlic pods, 1 1/2 tbsp channa dal or Senaga pappu, 1 1/2 tbsp of sai minapappu, 5 dried red Chilli, 2 tsp mustard seeds, small bunch of curry leaves or karvepaku and any vegetable oil. 

In 6-7 tbsp of oil, add the garlic pods and stir for 30 seconds. Add the Chana dal or Senaga pappu and stir for another 30 seconds. Next add the sai minapappu and stir for a few seconds. Add the dried red chillies next and stir again. 
Add mustard seeds and stir for another few seconds. Finally add the curry leaves of Karivepaku and stir for the last few seconds. Be careful as the oil can splatter when you add the leaves. 
Now pour this hot oil mixture into the bowl on top of the allam Pacchadi. Mix well and it‚Äôs ready! Enjoy with some hot rice or South Indian breakfast.

Here is the recipe...
- Ingredients - 
2 tbsp Olive oil
2 finely chopped Shallots 
2 finely chopped Garlic cloves 
30g Dried Porcini Mushrooms 
40g Unsalted Butter 
1tsp Fresh Thyme 
200g Arborio Rice
110ml White Wine 
6-8 cups of Chicken or Veg Stock & Porcini Mushroom Liquid (Keep a watch on it after 6 cups of liquid)
300 - 400g Mushrooms (Here I used Yellow leg mushrooms but you can use anything you like)
110g Parmesan Cheese 
4 tbsp chopped fresh Parsley
Salt + Pepper to taste 

Instructions - 
- Hydrate the dried porcini mushrooms in hot water for 10 minutes 
- Drain and keep the liquid aside & chop the porcini mushrooms into small pieces 
- In a pan, add olive oil, shallots and garlic and cook for a few minutes until they soften
- Add chopped porcini, a small cube of butter and thyme and cook for a few more minutes 
- Add the rice and cook for one minute
- Deglaze the pan with white wine and cook until all the wine is absorbed and evaporated 
- Add the porcini mushroom liquid and only when the liquid is fully absorbed by the rice, add the next ladle. Keep stirring constantly. 
- Keep a watch on the consistency of the rice and add more stock ONLY if you think it needs more
- When the rice is 5 minutes away from being al dente, add the mushrooms. When to add the mushrooms will depend on what type of mushrooms you're using. Here I'm using yellow leg mushrooms which don't take long to cook but if you're using other mushrooms that take longer to cook, add them to the pan before adding the rice and cook for 5 minutes.
- Add loads of parmesan and some more butter and cook until they are fully melted 
- Add salt and pepper according to your taste 
- Finally garnish with chopped fresh parsley, more parmesan and its ready to be served.

ENJOY and see you next week :)

We‚Äôre going to visit the famous Secunderabad club in Hyderabad, see all the delicious food they serve and we‚Äôre going to learn how to make an incredible Kheema Biryani from expert Hyderabadi chefs. 

Let‚Äôs first get to know the club. 

Secunderabad was the largest cantonment in India and amongst the most notable institutional buildings in this cantonment is the sprawling 17 acre Secunderabad Club. 

Once a property of Salar Jung the 2nd, the land and buildings were gifted by him to the then Secunderabad public rooms.

While not adhering to any particular historical period in its architectural design, the club house still exudes a dominating colonial grandeur by its inherit use of space, building materials and detailing of its individual components. 

Over its wood panelling, art nouveau frescos and turfed acres, history pauses at the Secunderabad Club. 

In it‚Äôs current evolution, the club is well equipped with - a library with over 50,000 books, restaurants, bars, the historic ballroom, multiple lounges, a swimming pool, various other sports facilities, a massive gorgeous lawn and most importantly for me, more than 50 chefs contributing to an impressive spread of:
Continental 
Mughali 
South Indian  
Pizzas 
Pan Asian food & so much more. 

Food at the Secunderabad Club is a massive undertaking that has been nurtured and cultured to cater to it‚Äôs ever loving members.

Jump on any chance to tag along with a member and enjoy a part of Hyderabadi history.

Now let‚Äôs make the Kheema Biryani. 

To make the Kheema Marinade 
In the big bowl of 1 kg lamb minced meat, add 3 tbsp Ginger garlic paste, 1/4th onion slices finely, 2 tsp shah Jeera, 5-6 cloves, 3-4 big cinnamon sticks,  5 cardamom seeds, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 2 tbsp green Chilli paste, 2 tbsp red Chilli powder, 1/2 cup coriander leaves, 1/4 cup mint leaves, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp lemon juice, 300g fried onions, 300g curd, 100g ghee, 50 ml any vegetable oil, 3 green chillies sliced in half and mix everything well & leave it to marinade for atleast half an hour. 

To make the rice, 
In a big pan with 3 L boiling water, add 3-4 sticks of cinnamon, 1 tsp shah Jeera, 3 cloves, 3 cardamom, 1/2 tsp Chilli paste, 1 tbsp coriander leaves, 5 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp mint leaves. 
Add the 1 kg pre soaked basmati rice and cook until it‚Äôs 3/4th done. The rice was previous soaked in water for 1 hour. 

Test the rice from time to time to see how it‚Äôs cooking and when its 60% done, add half of it on top of the meat.

Let the other half rice boil until it‚Äôs 80% cooked and add it to the top of the first rice layer. 

This ensures that the bottom layer of rice doesn‚Äôt over cook and the top layer of rice  cooks to perfection. 

Add 1 cup of the rice liquid all over 
Add 1-2 tbsp of saffron milk
3 tbsp of ghee 
1/4 tsp cardamom powder 
1/2 cup fried onions 
1 tbsp finely chopped Mint leaves
1 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves 

Add the dough to the corners of the dish, leaving a few small gaps for the steam to escape. 
On medium heat, let it cook for 45 minutes. 

Serve the Biryani hot with some boiled eggs. Garnish with extra fried onions, little bit of fresh mint and coriander leaves and enjoy!

My goal is to take you to the real food places in Barcelona so when you visit, you don‚Äôt get caught in the ‚Äòtourist trap‚Äô restaurants. 
So today, I‚Äôm taking you to one of favourite Tapas places which I think everyone must visit when they visit Barcelona. 


Founded in 1914, the Quimet & Quimet is one of the best-known tapas bars in Barcelona.
It has the perfect atmosphere for a quick snack & a drink. The walls are filled with hundreds of wine bottles and they make some really good beer & vermut. I absolutely love the vermut here but they have lots of other drinks too, so ask the waiter to suggest you something and he‚Äôll definitely surprise you with an interesting choice. 

They don‚Äôt take reservations and each table has a 45 minutes slot after which you have to leave so it‚Äôs the perfect place to start your evening and then move onto the next tapas bar. 

They are specialists in can preserves, so all the dishes are served cold. That‚Äôs their hallmark and what makes them unique. 
You can look at the menu and order what you like or let the waiter advise you and you will surely be surprised.

Some of my favourites are‚Ä¶.
Montaditos with Salmon, Yoghurt & Truffle Honey
Montaditos with Mussels, Tomato & Caviar
Montaditos with Goats Cheese & Dried Tomato 
Montaditos with Artichoke, Cheese & Caviar 
Montaditos with Smoked Oyster & Red Pepper
Montaditos with Foie Gras with Volcanic Salt 
They have endless options so try EVERYTHING!

This Perugu Vankaya was one of my grandads favourite dishes and I‚Äôm so excited I finally got to learn how to make it! It‚Äôs sooo easy n delicious! üôÇ

Here‚Äôs the recipe 

Ingredients- 
250g Vankaya or Brinjal
1 medium Drumstick 
1 tbsp red Chilli powder 
1/4 tsp turmeric 
1 green Chilli 
1 medium onion (finely chopped)
2 tbsp Oil 
1/8 tsp menthulu or fenugreek 
1/2 tsp Jeera 
1/4 tsp mustard seeds 
1/2 tsp Sai minapappu or urad dal 
50g cashews (soaked)
500g or 1/2 kg Yoghurt or curd 
100g Meegadi or cream 
Salt to taste 


- To start with, cut 250g Vankaya or brinjal into thin slices and place them in salt water. This salt water will prevent them from browning. 

- Once they‚Äôre all cut, drain the water and add 1 medium drumstick cut into small pieces. 

- Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt,  100g Meegada or cream, 50 g cashews, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1/4 tsp turmeric and mix well. 

- Add 500g or curd or yoghurt and mix well again. Leave this aside for a bit. 

- In a heated pan, add 3 tsp any vegetable oil. To this, add 1/8 tsp fenugreek or menthulu, 1/2 tsp of sai minapappu and stir for a few seconds. Then add 1/2 tsp Jeera or cumin seeds, 1/4 tsp mustard seeds and stir for another few seconds. 
Add 1 green Chilli, 1 medium red onion and saut√© for a few minutes until the onions soften a little. 

- Reduce the heat and pour in the yoghurt mixture little by little and constantly keep stirring. 

- If you don‚Äôt stir constantly at this stage, the mixture will split. So constantly stir for the next 15-20 minutes. 

- After 20 minutes and once it reaches the bubbling stage, you can stop stirring. Place the lid on top and cook for another 15-20 minutes stirring a few times in between. 

It‚Äôs as easy as that! 

Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and it‚Äôs ready! 
Enjoy!

Sheer Khurma is traditionally eaten for breakfast on Eid and it‚Äôs one of my favourite sweet dishes. 
It‚Äôs so delicate yet incredibly rich and flavourful. It‚Äôs so easy to make, you‚Äôre going to love it. 

Ingredients - 
1 tbsp Almonds 
1 tbsp Pistachios
1 tbsp Cashews
1 tbsp Dates 
1 tbsp Raisins 
1 tbsp Choronji 
2 tbsp Unsweetened Khova 
40-50g Dry roasted extra thin Semiya 
2 tbsp Ghee
500-600ml Milk 
1/2 cup sugar 
1/2 tsp Cardamom powder 
Saffron few strands 
1/4 cup of Cashew almond paste (blend 5 -10 soaked cashews, 5-10 soaked almonds in 1-2 tbsp milk) 


- First soak 1tbsp chironji, 1tbsp cashews, 1tbsp almonds, 1tbsp raisins, 1tbsp pistachios in hot water for 5-10 minutes after which we‚Äôre going to peel away the skins. Once all the skins are removed, cut the big nuts into thin pieces and keep them aside. 

- The dates don‚Äôt need soaking. Just cut them into long thin pieces. We need 5-6 dates 

- Remove the cardamom seeds from the pods and grind them into a fine powder. We need 1/2 tsp of cardamom powder. 

- In a heated pan, add 2 tsp ghee and add all the nuts and dry fruits. The dates, almonds, pistachios, raisins, and chironji. Saut√© them in the ghee for a few minutes on low to medium heat until they all turn slightly golden brown. Then transfer them to a plate and keep aside. 

- In the same pan, add another 2 tsp of ghee and add 40-50g of semiya. This semiya was already already dry roasted in the shop but now it‚Äôs time to roast them in ghee to make them extra flavourful. On low heat, roast this for a few minutes until they just start to change colour and become a slightly darker brown. 

- In a pan, heat 500-600ml of milk and add few strands of saffron to it and let the saffron infuse its colour and flavour into the milk. 

- In a bowl, separate 2 tbsp of unsweetened khova into tiny pieces and add 1-2 tbsp of hot milk to it. Mix it well until all the khova melts fully and becomes a thick paste and leave it aside. 

- In the milk pan, add 1/2 cup sugar, all the ghee roasted nuts and dry fruits, the ghee roasted semiya and mix well for 2 minutes. 

- Now add the melted khova, 1/4 cup of cashew & almond paste, cardamom powder and mix well. 

- Simmer this on medium heat and bring this to a gentle boil. 

- Once it reaches a boil, it‚Äôs ready! 
Serve it hot and enjoy!

With Watches and Wonders out of the way for another year, we think it's a perfect time to have a look at the ol‚Äô second-hand market and see what watches people are trying to sell in order to buy a newer model. 

There are definitely some bargains to be had, so let‚Äôs look at some of them in this video. We have 5 finds for you today - plus one additional bonus watch, and it's a bonus for a good reason.

Before we begin, it is so important to make sure you are staying safe online when buying second-hand. If you see an offer that looks too good to be true, it‚Äôs probably too good to be true!

If James Bond were a real person, what kind of watches would he wear? Chris has scoured the market for watches he thinks the big man himself would most approve of. 

We are not including Rolex, Tudor, or Omega watches on this list. A - it'll be too easy, and it's more fun to try and think out of the box and B - modern-day Rolex is all about wait lists and flex culture. 

Finally, we won‚Äôt be including any military issue watches on this list. Again, it would be too easy to fill up this list with actual military issues watches like CWC that pretty much supply to the military exclusively, just so we‚Äôre clear!

So when Kuoe reached out to us to make this video, we took notice. The 3 watches they sent us today, showcase the scale of their collection ‚Äì  the Old Smith is a classic field watch, Sombrero is their internal bezelled diver and finally the Royal Smith has that old school classic charm.

Kuoe has only been going since 2020, and before we got hands on with the watches we looked for some reviews online and we have to say that generally people seem like them and you can see why in this video.

ENGLISH TRANSLATION
""On Foreign Inheritances""

President Garber, most esteemed deans, most wise professors, most distinguished guests, friends, families, and my beloved fellow students: welcome all!

It is a great honor for me to address you all. This oration is not only unintelligible to those without Latin, but even the crew of trained students of antiquity who can read and write the Latin language but cannot speak or hear it need a translation, especially me. Therefore, you all who are listening are only waiting for the one funny sentence in English (which is coming, don‚Äôt worry!). You check your watches and wonder aloud when Abraham Verghese, or really anyone speaking in English, will speak! What is the reason for speaking Latin? I ask for patience; I will offer an explanation.

Before this day of great joy, the ties that bind us together were hard to see. Our fellow students were not so much our neighbors as strangers. Students of the humanities journeyed to Harvard Yard, while students of sciences journeyed into exile on the far side of the mighty River Charles, a river more important than the Rubicon. Those strange times when we came together ‚Äî in GenEd discussion section ‚Äî were frightening. How horrible to say! We might as well have been saying ‚Äúthe barbarians are at the gates!‚Äù when we shouted that ‚Äúthere is a mathematician in my literature class!‚Äù or that ‚Äúa Social Studies concentrator is trying to code!‚Äù

Oh, the times! Oh, the customs! We do not understand each other, and indeed, even the orator speaks a language so obscure that anyone listening could rightly exclaim ‚Äúwhat is this guy saying!?‚Äù As we study foreign subjects, so do we speak foreign languages. Some speak the language of history, others the language of Python or C++, some that of microbes, others that of stars. We often lack a common language. Will our many inheritances be forever separated?

Not at all! We speak many foreign languages; but we stand together, and we learn together, we cheer on our athletes and Olympians together, and most importantly, we condemn those detestable Yalies together and their savage tyrant ‚ÄúHandsome Dan.‚Äù

In the same way, the Latin language is familiar to some and unfamiliar to others, but it is one inheritance handed down as a benefit for all. Foreign inheritances strengthen the ties that bind us together. Perhaps you have heard from the seat of power that your inheritance is not worthy of praise, but that it is alien or confusing or lesser. To you, I say this: neither powers nor princes can judge your inheritance. Neither powers nor princes can take your inheritance away. And neither powers nor princes can change the truth and deny that diversity is our strength.

What is the reason for speaking Latin? It is this: to remember that every inheritance, however unfamiliar, adds to our fortunes. The cultivation of a better world demands all languages. It demands all of us. The ship of the world will not be righted by the eyebrow-raising hyper-critic complaining that the believer in justice has stepped out of the marching column of ignorance, but by the artist who becomes a prophet of a better world, by the doctor who cares for those wounded by the whips and chains of the world, and by the student of history who tears out the familiar inequities of the world by the root. We will right it, together.

As the dutiful Aeneas once emboldened the spirits of his crew, so now I encourage you: ‚ÄúEndure. And preserve yourselves for better times to come.‚Äù Until those better times: Farewell!",0,,3681,0

Today we beat Minecraft but in a car with Dream and Georgenotfound and Sapnap too, we all had fun just like they have fun in Minecraft manhunt. Dream said that he would drive the car and beat the game in it, Sapnap also said that he would drive the Minecraft car and beat the game in it, Georgenotfound also said that he would drive the car in Minecraft and beat the Minecraft game in the Minecraft car. But you won't guess what, I also said I'd beat the Minecraft game car in a car Minecraft beating the game the car the game Minecraft. This was actually hilarious, as we all know, Minecraft cars make Minecraft funnier.

JESSE! Hank from Breaking Bad is playing Minecraft, this is bad for the operation. Just kidding, it's great because Minecraft is the game Hank from Breaking Bad is playing today along with GeorgeNotFound who is also in the Dream Minecraft Dream Manhunt videos and GeorgeNotFound never wins by the way which is funny, and BadBoyHalo another friend who is also in the Dream Minecraft Manhunt Videos. Hank Breaking Bad AKA Dean Norris is one of the funniest Minecraft players I know, I actually love Hank Breaking Bad and Breaking Bad the show, it is very good. So now that we have Hank Breaking Bad playing Minecraft with me Quackity, GeorgeNotFound, and BadBoyHalo, this is simply the best day of my life.

All jokes aside, Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows of all time, without a doubt. To be able to have the honor of having Dean Norris play Minecraft with me still doesn't feel real. I'll tell you firsthand he is one of the sweetest kindest guys ever, and even though I put him through this pain of being in this silly video, he was so kind about everything. Dean Norris 4 evr.

Today we beat Minecraft but in a shopping cart with Dream and Georgenotfound, I put on my best divorced dad outfit as well. Dream said that he would push us in this Minecraft shopping cart with Georgenotfound in Minecraft in the shopping cart but the problem with Dream and his Minecraft videos is that this is no Minecraft Manhunt videos that Dream and Georgenotfound do on Dream's Minecraft Manhunt Channel this is the shopping cart Minecraft challenge, it's like a challenge of Minecraft Manhunt But instead its Minecraft Shopping cart Challenge with Dream and Georgenotfound, they are both awful at playing Minecraft in a shopping cart, in fact I could probably be the 6th hunter in the Minecraft Manhunt series and Dream would never win. In fact I could be the only hunter and win Minecraft Manhunt and Dream would cry.

James Charles is a beauty youtuber who possibly does not play minecraft nor roblox for a living because he does not do roblox nor minecraft for a living, that's just my guess. So today it is my duty to make James Charles experience the alike games of minecraft and roblox, but more specifically roblox because he probably already tried minecraft but I'll show him minecraft too if he wants I can definitely do that and teach him to play minecraft or roblox that would be very funny.

KSI today decided to play Minecraft with me, quackity, on the DreamSMP which is a Minecraft server owned by Dream in Minecraft, so KSI being KSI and Minecraft being Minecraft I decided it was a great idea for me, quackity, to bring KSI onto DreamSMP which is the Minecraft server owned by Dream. This is gonna be amazing because KSI knows nothing about Minecraft let alone the DreamSMP server. So many big creators have came on the DreamSMP like Ninja and Pokimane but this time around it's KSI's time to shine on Dream's Minecraft server DreamSMP.

CLARIFICATIONS: 
- At 0:12, we say that ingenuity is 680g which is its weight on Mars. On Earth however, it weighs around 1800g.
-A Patreon supporter named Zeus pointed out that we were wrong about Perseverance's/Ingenuity's position on Mars. It is in the Northern Hemisphere and hence Mars would be getting closer to the Sun as it goes into winter.
- Ingenuity was on Mars for 1004 Earth days.

Today Schlatt makes a Tier List! It's been a long time since this has happened. Last time I tried making a tier list video you guys just made fun of my name. But we're back, baby! Schlatt loves candy (I hate writing in the third person) and decided to make a Candy Tier List and Rank Every Candy Known To Man. This is probably quite similar to Moist Cr1tikal Tier List videos, even though I've never watched a single one. Thank you for inventing Tier List Videos. KitKat, Hershey's, Mr. Beast Feastables, Butterfinger, Skittles, M&M's, Heath, Twizzler's, Reese's, Swedish Fish, Sour Patch Kids, Mentos, Tootsie Rolls, Dots, Nerds, Snickers, Airheads, Dairy Milk, Almond Joy, 100 Grand, Mounds, Toblerone, Milky Way, Laffy Taffy, and more are featured in this video and also in this description for SEO purposes. What rank will Schlatt give your favorite candy? Watch the entire video to find out (and also to help me make more money!)

My Mom got me Minecraft 15 years ago and I think it turned out to be her best gift ever! So today I decided to repay her by teaching her how to beat Minecraft 1.21 by defeating the Ender Dragon. It was a struggle but it was so worth it to see her reaction at the end!

I decided to live inside of Minecraft for 150 days. I couldn't take the headset off. Not to eat, drink, sleep, nothing. I woke up, and went to bed, fully immersed in Minecraft. This was an insane journey. It took me over 2 years to fully edit and put together this video.

After a long 2023 with no uploads, a lot of stress, and me finally moving to America, I'm excited to return to uploading on YouTube! I have so many ideas. This video occupied a big spot in my mind even when I wasn't working on it. There was over 50 hours of footage to go through and edit! I'm very glad I finished it, and extremely proud of how it turned out :)

It was very touching to go through and relive some of these fun memories and moments with friends, years later. Hopefully it's a blast from the past and reminds everyone of 2021, and some of the awesome memories we all made online during lockdown. Check out their channels below:

I've been trying to fly to America for years now and now I'm finally able to! I packed up my stuff, said goodbye to my friends and family and not only flew but MOVED to Orlando, Florida with two of my best friends in the world.

These are some of the happiest memories of my life that I will remember and cherish forever. Thank you for every single person who has come along on this crazy journey with me. From gaming and playing Minecraft on my computer to actually physically meeting the friends who I started this all with is actually insane.

We decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a SPY instead of just a normal speedrunner.

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend Dream tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do something crazier.

Mythical Kitchen: @mythicalkitchen 

I heard Minecraft made an official cookbook, and I had already tried all the Minecraft food myself, so I thought I HAD to try the OFFICIAL cookbook and see what it's like. I brought my friends GeorgeNotFound and Dream to try with me. This was our first real life Minecraft challenge as the Dream Team! The recipes were more complicated than my first time trying Minecraft food in my video ""I Ate EVERY Minecraft Food In Real Life..."", so we couldn't just use Dream's mom to cook it all. We had to hire professional chefs.

I don't know any professional chefs, so I thought of reaching out to some of the best chefs on Youtube at the Mythical Kitchen! They make all the food behind the scenes for Rhett & Link at Good Mythical Morning, so I thought they would have plenty of experience making food to be judged by us. We tried food from Minecraft cake to Minecraft suspicious stew and rated them on a scale of one hunger bar to ten, based on the OFFICIAL Minecraft Cookbook recipe. Unfortunately no spider eyes or raw meat, because this is straight from Mojang, and they made sure all the recipes were safe.

If this video gets a ridiculous amount of likes (500,000 ? that seems impossible), we will try and have professional chef's recreate every Minecraft food from in game, as accurate to survival Minecraft 1.20 as possible. So basically a combination of this video, and my old video, and with George and Dream being forced to eat the nasty food with me...

We decided to take on Herobrine in Minecraft Manhunt! This video is a different rendition of normal Manhunt, where we go up against an AI bot that has abilities like the legend of Herobrine!

Herobrine has and probably always will be Minecraft's greatest evil villain. If Steve is Minecraft's best friend, Herobrine is it's enemy.

This was super challenging, but was a lot of fun. We made a video a while ago where we took on a terminator, and this is similar to that, but even more advanced and with special abilities!

Baritone: https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone

This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend AND my friend AND my friend tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.

If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin

This is the second challenge in our duel for $100,000. We are dueling in 10 different Minecraft Skills on the latest version of Minecraft. If Dream wins this match, he wins overall 2 - 0, and wins $100,000. If Daquavis wins this match, it will be tied 1 - 1, and there will be a Manhunt as a tie breaker.

Girls are often taught that being proud of your culture means accepting the patriarchy, but cultural pride shouldn‚Äôt require inequality. The two aren‚Äôt the same.

Being a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù can mean speaking up, being kind, chasing your dreams, advocating for others, and showing compassion. Goodness should feel liberating, not like a box you‚Äôre trapped in.

Talking to Bhumi reminded me why I believe stories can change culture. Whether it‚Äôs female pleasure or body positivity, she uses her voice to spark conversations that matter.

So what makes her who she is? We talk about her childhood, why she turns down certain roles, and her unexpected reaction to Thank You For Coming.

Her words, not mine ‚Äî it was quite an orgasmic conversation.
